ERROR: a function asked for an inappropriate amount of memory:  0 bytes
       This can mean one of two things:
       1.  The input file is incorrect (perhaps it was not saved as Text Only),
       2.  There is a bug in the program.
       Please check your input file carefully.
       If it seems to be a bug, please mail joe@genetics.washington.edu
       with the name of the program, your computer system type,
       a full description of the problem, and with the input data file.
       (which should be in the body of the message, not as an Attachment).
Hit Enter or Return to close program.
  You may have to hit Enter or Return twice.
